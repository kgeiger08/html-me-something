        <h2><a name="myStory">My Story</a></h2>
        <p>I have been overweight most of my life and struggled with eating healthy.
            Just last year around November 2019 I decided it was time to make a change. 
            I was the heaviest I had ever been and if I wanted to have children I knew I needed to make a change.I wanted to be healthy and and feel better. At my heaviest simple tasks were now difficult and uncomfortable.So I ended up starting to make healthier choices and lost about 10lbs by January 2020.On January 12, 2020 I joined WW (Weight Watchers) and it has been life changing. Since January 2020 I have lost about 75lbs to date and feel so much better! I am not at my goal yet, but I am headed in the right direction.
            I'm so proud of myself and how far I have come and I am so very grateful for WW! It has been a wonderful lifestyle change and the WW community is so supportive!

        <h2><a name="food">My Favorite Healthy Foods</a></h2>
        <p>One thing I love about WW is that you can still eat whatever you like just in smaller portions and in moderation. There are a lot of foods that I enjoy eating on a regular basis and recipes I like to cook often that are all healthy and nutritious. I'm always looking for simple easy healthy recipes to make as well! Here is a list of healthy foods I eat on a regular basis.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Homemade Tacos</li>
            <li>Low Fat or Fat Free Cottage Cheese</li>
            <li>Greek Yogurt</li>
            <li>Fruit</li>

               Cooked in a 6qt Instant Pot Pressure Cooker

               <h4>Ingredients</h4>
               <ul>
                <li>1 can Pinto Beans - drained &amp; rinsed</li>
                <li>1 can Black Beans - drained &amp; rinsed</li>
                <li>1 can Diced Tomatos - not drained</li>
                <li>1 can Rotel - not drained</li>
                <li>1 cup Chicken broth or water - I usually end up adding more</li>
                <li>1 cup Frozen Corn</li>
                <li>1&nbsp;lb 98&#37; Fat Free Ground Chicken Breast (lean ground turkey breast can also be used or traditional lean ground beef)</li>
                <li>&frac14; cup McCormick Taco Seasoning</li>

                <h4>Instructions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Spray cooking spray in the instant pot. Put 1&nbsp;lb Ground Chicken into pot put McCormick taco seasoning and mix.</li>
                    <li>Dump can of diced tomatoes with juice and dump can of rotel with juice. Mix well. Add 1 cup of water possibly more if you receive burn message - see notes below.</li>
                    <li>Put Instant Pot lid on and set to sealing and manual pressure cook on high pressure for 10 mins. Once its done quick release pressure.</li>
                    <li>Stir it and then set pressure cooker to saut&eacute; mode. This is to help reduce the liquid. Stir occasionally. Once its bubbling add black beans, pinto beans, and corn into the pot and stir. Let saut&eacute; until the liquid has reduced some and the beans and corn are warmed. </li>
                    <li>Once the liquid has reduced you can put Instant Pot back on warm. It will thicken a bit more as it sits too. It's ready to serve! Enjoy</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            * NOTE - If you receive burn message hit cancel and then carefully open lid and scrap off bits stuck to bottom of pot until all off. Then add a tad more liquid and put lid back on and turn the knob to sealing and set it again. It will not affect the taste and it is not actually burnt.
            * Also you can add a chopped onion if you would like to add more flavor to your taco meat. Also great served over rice with all the taco toppings you love!

        <p>
            Along my journey I have had to adjust my mindset about food. I have had to eat smaller portions and know that I can still be satisfied. I still eat my favorite foods like pizza, ice cream, chips, and various &quot;not so good for you&quot; foods, but on occasion of course. I have to be a bit more careful now since I have had my gallbladder removed recently. Even eating the not so healthy foods I have still lost weight and made progress.

        <p>
            I have also started a bit of fitness as well to help boost my weightloss journey. I usually walk about a mile everyday. Starting slow and eventually work my way to walking a lot more! Then eventually lifting weights to streghtehn and tone my muscles.
