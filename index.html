        <h2><a name="myStory">My Story</a></h2>
        <p>I have been overweight most of my life and struggled with eating healthy.
            Just last year around November 2019 I decided it was time to make a change. 
            I was the heaviest I had ever been and if I wanted to have children I knew I needed to make a change.
            I wanted to be healthy and and feel better. At my heaviest simple tasks were now difficult and uncomfortable.
            So I ended up starting to make healthier choices and lost about 10lbs by January 2020.
            On January 12, 2020 I joined WW (Weight Watchers) and it has been life changing. 
            Since January 2020 I have lost about 75lbs to date and feel so much better! I am not at my goal yet, but I am headed in the right direction.
            I'm so proud of myself and how far I have come and I am so very grateful for WW! It has been a wonderful lifestyle change and the WW community is so supportive!

        <h2><a name="food">My Favorite Healthy Foods</a></h2>
        <p>One thing I love about WW is that you can still eat whatever you like just in smaller portions and in moderation.
            There are a lot of foods that I enjoy eating on a regular basis and recipes I like to cook often that are all healthy and nutritious.
            Here is a list of healthy foods I eat on a regular basis.
